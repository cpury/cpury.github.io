If you have not heard about [Andrej Karpathy](http://karpathy.github.io/)'s incredibly awesome [blog post](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) about Recurrent Neural Networks, I recommend you drop everything and head over there right now!

Needless to say, I nearly fainted as I thought of all the cool applications I could try this on. Expect more updates on this in the coming weeks for sure.

For now, let's be a little blasphemous: Here's a Recurrent Neural Network trained on the King James Bible giving us Holy Scripture:

> 11:22 And the sons of Jesus said unto them, The sword shall not be able to
> the angels.
> 
> 10:2 And there were not a servant of the day of the day, and the works of
> the camp, and all the flocks of the congregation of the heathen, and the sun
> shall serve thee.
> 
> 22:24 And the LORD shall see me with the house of the LORD's house, that the men of God
> for the heavens of the gates of the head of the kings
> of the children of Israel.
> 
> 23:24 And Joshua said unto them, When they shall see the land of the king's hand,
> and the same which is in all the rivers of the earth.
> 
> 12:11 And the waters shall come to pass, as the men of God is a poor of the nations of all
> the waters of the sun of the captivity of the morning, and set up
> them, and said unto him, We have made the corner of the first and
> after thee.
> 
> 11:3 And the servants of the children of Israel said unto her, Why have I cometh to
> meet them upon the stars and hope in the truth to thee.
> 
> 24:2 And they were not his people, and have seen and thine anger, and there were the
> statutes, and all the things that the LORD
> commanded the same for them.
> 
> 6:7 And he said unto him, Go out of them that dwell in the sea, and the strangers of the earth.
> 
> 27:34 And the end of the congregation of the gates of the waters, that they came to pass, that the
> men of the beasts of the house of the LORD, and the
> kingdom of the face of the stones of the same to him, and shall see them to be
> displeased to can seven days.
> 
> 16:2 And the fourth shall the king of Israel spake unto the covenant of the sea, and there is a crown of the kings of the
> congregation, and the day of the first rejoice.
> 
> 10:14 And the brethren parted on the ship offerings, and the LORD said unto him,
> that thou art for the desolate of the sea.

**Amen!**

### Notes:

- I currently only have my MacBook Air, so training is slow. I thus stayed with the default parameters. Once I get a better model, I will update this post
- Note how the line numbers are not ordered, yet. It probably needs much more material to learn how they should increase
